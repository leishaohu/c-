- orbit-orbit interaction between the intrinsic OAM and the external degrees of freedom.

- The dynamical phase, the Dirac (Aharonov-Bohm) phase, and the Berry phase .

- The OAM Hall effect can be much stronger than the spin one since it is proportional to l, which formally can take arbitrarily large values.

# Angular momenta and spin-orbit interaction of nonparaxial light in free space  2010.7.19（PRA）

We give an exact self-consistent operator description of the spin and orbital angular momenta, position,
and spin-orbit interactions of nonparaxial light in free space. Both quantum-operator formalism and classical
energy-flow approach are presented. We apply the general theory to symmetric and asymmetric Bessel beams
exhibiting spin- and orbital-dependent intensity profiles. The exact wave solutions are clearly interpreted in
terms of the Berry phases, quantization of caustics, and Hall effects of light, which can be readily observed
experimentally.



- For nonparaxial fields the identification of OAM and SAM meets serious difficulties.
- (i) noncanonical OAM and SAM operators obtained earlier for the second-quantized fields ;
-  (ii) noncommutative photon-position operator and Berry monopole field in momentum space 
- (iii) separation of the spin and orbital parts of Poynting energy flows .





# Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams: Angular Momentum and Spin-Orbit Interaction 2011.10.21（PRL）

Motivated by the recent discovery of electron vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum (AM),
we construct exact Bessel-beam solutions of the Dirac equation. They describe relativistic and nonparaxial
corrections to the scalar electron beams. We describe the spin and orbital AM of the electron with Berryphase
corrections and predict the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in free space. This can be observed as a
spin-dependent probability distribution of the focused electron vortex beams. Moreover, the magnetic
moment is calculated, which shows different g factors for spin and orbital AM and also contains the
Berry-phase correction.

the latter terms describe the intrinsic SOI, determined by the strength $\Delta$  , which vanishes both in the paraxial $(\theta_0 \rightarrow 0)$ and nonrelativistic $(p \rightarrow 0)$ limits
as $\Delta \approx \theta_0^2p/m$.

However, in the general nonparaxial relativistic case $\Delta \neq 0$, the Bessel beams $\psi_l^s$ are eigenmodes of the total AM  $J_z=L_z+\Sigma_z$, but not of the OAM and SAM separately. This also demonstrates the SOI.

The drastic difference between $\rho_1^+(0)$ and $\rho_1^-(0)$ should be experimentally observable.



**The distributions $\rho_l^s$ and $|j_l^s|$ are invariant with respect to the transformation $(l,s)\rightarrow (-l,-s)$, but neither with respect to $(l,s)\rightarrow (-l,s)$ nor $(l,s)\rightarrow (l,-s)$ , which reflects the $l\cdot s$ symmetry typical of SOI.**



To conclude, we have constructed the exact cylindrical solutions of the Dirac equation, which exhibit nontrivial spin- and vortex-dependent properties. The intrinsic SOI phenomena originate from the Berry-phase terms and can be observed experimentally. We have calculated the observable OAM, SAM, and magnetic moment for exact relativistic electron vortex states.





# Spin–orbit interactions of light   nature photonics 2015.11.27

Light carries both spin and orbital angular momentum. These dynamical properties are determined by the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of light. Nano-optics, photonics and plasmonics tend to explore subwavelength scales and additional degrees of freedom of structured — that is, spatially inhomogeneous — optical fields. In such fields, spin and orbital properties become strongly coupled with each other. In this Review we cover the fundamental origins and important applications of the main spin–orbit interaction phenomena in optics. These include: spin-Hall effects in inhomogeneous media and at optical interfaces, spin-dependent effects in nonparaxial (focused or scattered) fields, spin-controlled shaping of light using anisotropic structured interfaces (metasurfaces) and robust spin-directional coupling via evanescent near fields. We show that spin–orbit interactions are inherent in all basic optical processes, and that they play a crucial role in modern optics.

- The intrinsic SOI of light originate from the fundamental spin properties of Maxwell’s equations and, there
  fore, are analogous to the SOI of relativistic quantum particles and electrons in solids.

## Angular momenta and geometric phases

These three types of optical AM can be associated with circular polarizations, optical vortices inside the beam, and beam trajectory, respectively.
